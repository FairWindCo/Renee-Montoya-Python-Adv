Linux
1. Create `linux_lecture` directory and notes.txt file
   mkdir linux_lecture
   cat >notes.txt

2. Copy notes.txt file to linux_lecture directory
   cp ./notes.txt linux_lecture/

3. List the files in the current directory, in “long listing format”.
    ls -l

4. List all files, including hidden files, in the your home (~) directory, in reverse alphabetical order and long listing format.
    ls -ral

5*. Rename the file notes.txt to new_notes.txt
    mv notes.txt new_notes.txt

Hint: Renaming is done using the same command as moving.
6. Remove the files linux_lecture/notes.txt and new_notes.txt. Note that your answer must be a single command and not multiple commands.
Hint: Many commands can accept more than one parameter.
    rm ./linux_lecture/notes.txt new_notes.txt

Create homework.sh file under linux_lecture directory
    cat >./linux_lecture/homework.sh

7*. Set the file homework.sh to have a last-modified date of January 1, 2020, 4:15am.
    touch -m -t 202001011615 ./linux_lecture/homework.sh
Hint: The man page for the proper command describes the timestamp 'STAMP' format to use. Look for this!
Also note: Linux is case-sensitive when you are specifying file or directory names.
You can use a * (asterisk) as a “wild-card” character to specify a group of files.
For example, *foo means all files whose names end with foo, and foo* means all files whose names begin with foo.
You can use a wildcard in the middle of a file name, such as foo*bar for all files that start with foo and end with bar.

Create hw.sh, hw1.sh, hw2.sh, hw1.txt under the linux_lecture directory

cat >./linux_lecture/hw.sh
cat >./linux_lecture/hw1.sh
cat >./linux_lecture/hw2.sh
cat >./linux_lecture/hw1.txt

8. Find all the files only with the extension .txt in the current directory.
    ls *.txt

9. Copy all the text files (files whose names end with .txt) from the current folder to the new directory `lecture_new`
    mkdir lecture_new;cp *.txt ./lecture_new/

10. Write `echo 'linux_lecture'` to the homework.sh file by using echo.
    echo 'linux_lecture' > linux_lecture/homework.sh

11. Display the contents of homework.sh
    less linux_lecture/homework.sh
    more linux_lecture/homework.sh

12. Change the permissions to just write for current user and try to Display contents again.
    chmod 200 linux_lecture/homework.sh

13. Change the permission to rwx for current user only and try again.
    chmod 700 linux_lecture/homework.sh

13a. Execute the homework.sh
    ./linux_lecture/homework.sh

14. Write from 1 to 10 in each line in homework.sh by using text reader.
    for VARIABLE in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10; do echo $VARIABLE>>./linux_lecture/homework.sh; done


🔍 Self Discovery: The head and tail commands output only the first or last few lines (respectively) of a file to the terminal.
    head ./linux_lecture/homework.sh
    tail ./linux_lecture/homework.sh

15. Display only the first 7 lines of the file homework.sh from the current directory on the terminal.
    head -7 ./linux_lecture/homework.sh

16*. Create notes.sh with `ls` and make it executable
    echo '!/bin/sh' >> notes.sh
    echo 'ls' >> notes.sh
    chmod 700 notes.sh
17*. Execute notes.sh
    ./notes.sh

GIT
1. Create a folder called cursor_git
    mkdir cursor_git

2. cd into the cursor_git folder.
    cd cursor_git

3. Create a file called first.py.
    touch first.py

4. Add first.py to the staging area.
    git add .\first.py

5. Commit with the message "adding first.py".
    git commit -m "adding first.py"

6. Check out your commit with git log.
    git log

7. Create another file called second.py.
    touch second.py
8. Add second.py to the staging area.
    git add .\second.py
9. Commit with the message "adding second.py"
    git commit -m "adding second.py"
10. Remove the first.py file
    rm first.py

11. Add this change to the staging area
    git add .

12. Commit with the message "removing first.py"
    git commit -m "removing first.py"

13. Check out your commits using git log
    git log

14. Push your changes to remote
    git push git@github.com:FairWindCo/Renee-Montoya-Python-Adv

15. Create new branch from master called `first` (without checkout)
    git branch first

16. Create one more branch from master called `second` (with checkout to it)
    git checkout -b second

17. Change the second.py file with "print('Hello')" string.
    echo "print('Hello')" >second.py
18. Stash you changes and checkout to first branch.
    git stash
    git checkout first

19. Checkout back and Stash Pop the changes.
    git checkout second
    git stash pop

20. Add your changes to the staging area
    git add .
